#### 🔎 Includes:
🔹 Classes and objects (OOP)  
🔹 Inheritance (Librarian inherits from User)  
🔹 Class methods and static methods  
🔹 Conditions and loops

#### 🔎 Includes:
- Loops  
- Conditions  
- Built-in string methods  
- Boolean logic  
- Basic string formatting


## 🐍 calculate_factorial.py  
This Python script calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer entered by the user via the console.  
A factorial is the product of an integer and all the positive integers below it.  
For example:  5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120  
#### 🔎 Includes:  
- Input validation with try–except  
- Looping and conditional logic  
- Custom function with docstring  
- Basic error handling and user guidance


## 🐍 perfect_number.py  
This Python script checks whether a given positive integer is a perfect number or not.  
A perfect number is a number that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors (excluding itself).  
For example:  
6 → 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 ✅  
10 → 1 + 2 + 5 = 8 ❌  
#### 🔎 Includes:  
- Error handling (try-except block)  
- Loops and conditionals  
- Custom function with docstring  
- List methods
